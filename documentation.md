# <ins>**Spring Constant**</ins>
The spring constant, denoted as "**k**," is a fundamental property of a spring that quantifies its stiffness or rigidity. It defines the relationship between the force applied to a spring and the amount of deformation (either compression or extension) the spring undergoes in response to that force. In mathematical terms, the spring constant is described by Hooke's Law:
$$F = -kx$$
Where:
- F represents the force applied to the spring, measured in Newtons (N).
- k is the spring constant, measured in Newtons per meter (N/m).
- x is the deformation or displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position, measured in meters (m).

The negative sign indicates that the force exerted by the spring is in the opposite direction of the displacement.

## <ins>Experimental Overview:</ins>
In this experiment, we use a spring to investigate the relationship between mass and extension, aiming to determine the spring constants and validate Hooke's law.

We placed various masses on the spring and noted its elongations. We collected experimental data with two main variables:

| **Masses (grams)**             | 20   | 40  | 60  | 80    | 100  | 120  |
|--------------------------------|------|-----|-----|-------|------|------|
| **Elongations (centimeters)**  | 2.6  | 5.4 | 8.2 | 10.8  | 13.4 | 16.1 |

To calculate the spring constants (k), we use the formula:
$$k = \frac{mg}{x}$$
By applying this formula to each mass-extension pair, we obtain a set of spring constants.
â€‹After analyzing the experimental data, we calculate the spring constants, resulting in values such as:

7.55.15,7.27,7.18,7.23,7.32,7.31 N/m which is 7.32 N/m on average.

## <ins>Hooke's Law Validation:</ins>

We aim to validate Hooke's law, which predicts that the relationship between mass and elongation should yield a straight line on a graph. In our case, we plot a graph of mass (in grams) vs. elongation (in centimeters).

## <ins>Computational Work</ins>
- We used the `lambda` function along with `map` and `list` concepts to calculate the spring constants from the given data of masses and elongation.
- We plotted the graph using `Matplotlib` and drew a best-fit line using `polyfit` from the `NumPy` library.
- We separated our algorithm and created a file named - `python spring_const_graph.py`
- Also, we made `main.py` using our own modules (`spring_const_graph.py`) and ran the file using our experimental data into it.

### (i) lambda function, list, and map
We use `lambda` function mass (m) and elongation (x) as inputs to determine the spring constant (k). Also, we used a `list` and `map` to obtain all the values of spring constants for respective masses.

### (ii) New module created
We created a new module named `sping_const_graph.py` that contains two functions - `calculate_spring_constants()` and `plot_mass_vs_extension_with_trendline()`. 

#### a. calculate_spring_constants()
This is the main function that integrates the `lambda` function. It takes two inputs -- masses and elongations and returns spring constants of respective masses.

#### b. plot_mass_vs_extension_with_trendline()
This function also takes three arguments -- masses, elongations, and file_name and creates a scatter plot representing the relationship between mass and elongation. Additionally, it adds a best-fit trendline to the plot while also saving the plot as file_name.png. The default extension of saving picture is .png.

### New python file created
The file (`main.py`) uses the created module spring_const_graph and imports it to run our given data and gives us the output i.e. spring constant and a graph showing the relation between mass and its respective elongation.
